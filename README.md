# airbnb-powerbi-capstone-project

This repository contains my Power BI Capstone Project where I analyzed Airbnb listings across Chicago and New Orleans to extract pricing, host, and property insights etc.

## Tools Used 
Power BI: For dashboarding and visualization

Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation

DAX: Calculated measures and KPIs

Excel: Dataset combination and preprocessing

## Project Goals
Understand pricing trends across cities and neighbourhoods.

Analyze distribution of property and room types.

Study host behavior and their listing performance.

Create an interactive, multi-page dashboard for end-users.

 ## Key Dashboard Insights
Chicago vs. New Orleans:
Chicago had a higher proportion of entire home/apartment listings, while New Orleans had more private room listings, indicating different traveler preferences in the two cities.

 Popular Neighbourhoods:
Certain neighbourhoods like Lakeview (Chicago) and Faubourg Marigny (New Orleans) showed a high number of listings and relatively higher prices.

 Pricing Trends:

Average prices varied significantly by room type, with entire homes being the most expensive.

Prices also increased in areas with higher review counts, suggesting better-performing listings command premium rates.

 Property & Room Type Distribution:

Entire homes dominate overall listings.

Private rooms are mostly found in New Orleans and are generally more affordable.

 Host Behavior:

A small number of hosts manage multiple listings — these could be professional property managers.

The majority of hosts own only 1–2 listings, indicating Airbnb is still largely driven by individuals.

Map View:

Geospatial charts showed pricing hotspots across both cities.

Certain neighborhoods had dense clusters of listings and higher average prices.
