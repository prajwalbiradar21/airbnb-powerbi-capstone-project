# airbnb-powerbi-capstone-project

This repository contains my Power BI Capstone Project where I analyzed Airbnb listings across Chicago and New Orleans to extract pricing, host, and property insights etc.

## Tools Used

Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation
DAX: Calculated measures and KPIs
Excel: Dataset combination and preprocessing

## Project Goals
Understand pricing trends across cities and neighbourhoods.
Analyze distribution of property and room types.
Study host behavior and their listing performance.
Create an interactive, multi-page dashboard for end-users.
